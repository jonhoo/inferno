# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for collapsing the CSV output of the VTune `amplxe-cl` tool ([#148](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/148) by [@jasonrhansen](https://github.com/jasonrhansen)).

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.9.0] - 2019-09-11
### Changed
- Support for multi-threaded collapsing was moved behind the
  `multithreaded` feature flag which is on by default ([#146](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/146)).
- The `structopt` dependency has been updated, which bumps the minimum
  supported Rust version to 1.36.0 ([#145](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/145)).
- Support for nameattr files was moved behind the `nameattr` feature
  flag which is on by default ([#147](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/147)).

### Removed
- The `demangle` option for collapsers; we instead rely on the sample
  generator to demangle names, and then just do some post-processing
  fixups for common issues ([#144](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/144)).
- The dependency on `rand`. Reduces the footprint of the crate, and also
  makes the random color choices seeded by the same number each run
  ([#146](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/146)).

## [0.8.0] - 2019-07-24
### Added
- Changelog
- Support for collapsing the output of the `sample` tool on macOS ([#133](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/133) by [@jasonrhansen](https://github.com/jasonrhansen)).
- Multi-core stack collapsing for _major_ speedups ([#128](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/128) by [@bcmyers](https://github.com/bcmyers)).
- Support for "fluid drawing" of the SVG ([#136](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/136) by [@jasonrhansen](https://github.com/jasonrhansen)).
- Make zoom and search part of browser history ([#121](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/121) from [@AnderEnder](https://github.com/AnderEnder)).
  This is a backport of https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/pull/198 by [@versable](https://github.com/versable).
- The `--demangle` flag to collapsers for "re-doing" broken symbol demangling from DTrace or perf ([#132](https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno/pull/132) by [@jasonrhansen](https://github.com/jasonrhansen)).
- Unit tests for semantic coloring.
