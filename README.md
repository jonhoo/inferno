Inferno is a port of parts of the [flamegraph
toolkit](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) to Rust, with the
aim of improving the performance of the original flamegraph tools. The
primary focus is on speeding up the `stackcollapse-*` tools that process
output from various profiling tools into the "folded" format expected by
the `flamegraph` plotting tool. So far, the focus has been on parsing
profiling results from
[`perf`](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), and
`inferno-collapse-perf` is ~10x faster than `stackcollapse-perf`.

It is developed in part through live coding sessions, which you can find
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset). The first video in
the sequence is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTpK-bNZiA4).

# Dependency

You need to have the [`perf`](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) tool installed on your Linux systems.
This can involve installing package like `linux-tools-generic` for Ubuntu or `linux-tools` for Debian.
You may need to tweak a kernel config such as
```console
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
```
See [this stackoverflow answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/14256) for details.

# How to Use

Build Inferno
```console
$ cargo build --release
```

Run a program using profiling with perf
```console
$ perf record -g [your program]
```

Transform perf output to svg
```console
$ perf script | ./target/release/inferno-collapse-perf | ./target/release/inferno-flamegraph > out.svg
```

# Comparison to the Perl implementation

To compare performance, run `./compare.sh`. It requires [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).
